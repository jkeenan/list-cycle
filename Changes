        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        *   Added set_values() setter.  Thanks RJBS.
        *   Constructor now takes vals=>[list] or values=>[list].
            I don't like unnecessary abbreviations, but I don't want to
            break backward compatibility.

        [INTERNALS]
        *   Test suite now has full test coverage.  Thanks RJBS.

        First real version.  If you were using 0.01, I'm sorry.
        Change your constructor calls.
