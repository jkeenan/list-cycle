Revision history for List::Cycle

1.00
------------------------------------
[ENHANCEMENTS]
No longer loads UNIVERSAL.  Loading UNIVERSAL has been deprecated,
and isn't useful anyway.  This thread explains why it was done.

[ENHANCEMENTS]
*   Added set_values() setter.  Thanks RJBS.
*   Constructor now takes vals=>[list] or values=>[list].
    I don't like unnecessary abbreviations, but I don't want to
    break backward compatibility.

[INTERNALS]
*   Test suite now has full test coverage.  Thanks RJBS.

First real version.  If you were using 0.01, I'm sorry.
Change your constructor calls.
